# Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn patterns in a telecommunications company. By using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical tests, clustering, predictive modeling, and survival analysis, the project provides actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## Project Highlights

## Key Insights:

Month-to-month contracts and high monthly charges are strong indicators of churn.

Long-term customers have lower churn rates.

Electronic check users show higher churn likelihood.

Machine Learning:

Random Forest Classifier achieves 79% accuracy.

Identifies key predictors like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

Clustering Analysis:

Segments customers into high, medium, and low-risk groups for targeted strategies.

Survival Analysis:

Highlights critical retention period within the first 10 months.

## Repository Contents

Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean and encode data.

EDA & Visualizations: Heatmaps, count plots, and clustering graphs.

Modeling: Random Forest implementation and evaluation.

Retention Strategies: Insights and recommendations for customer retention.


## Key Visualizations

Correlation heatmap.

Customer segmentation scatter plot.

Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data-driven methods to identify churn patterns and provide actionable retention strategies. It showcases skills in data preprocessing, analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
